    <p class="lead">
    I am a graduate of Harvard University with a Bachelor of Arts in Statistics (Data Science) and a minor in Government. Raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, I gained experience as a political organizer and campaign manager, leveraging data to win important local elections during the competitive 2016, 2018, and 2020 election cycles. Now, I work as a data scientist, bringing my passion, technical know-how, and strong communication skills to new challenges at Booz Allen Hamilton.

    <strong>I love all things data.</strong> At its core, my passion fuels me with a desire to understand deeply, optimize organically, and innovate creatively. If I’m not immersed in the data, you may find me tending to my collection of rare house plants or playing Dungeons & Dragons. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My area of focus is Consumer Lifecycle Management.</strong> With an interest in understanding consumer behavior, my academic studies revolved around Marketing, Cognitive Psychology, and Data Science. Since then, my professional experience has been consumer-focused with acquisition, engagement, and retention emphasized in different roles.
