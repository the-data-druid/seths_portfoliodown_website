    <p class="lead">
    <strong>I love all things data.</strong> At its core, my passion fuels me with a desire to understand deeply, optimize organically, and innovate creatively. If I’m not immersed in the data, you may find me tending to my collection of rare house plants or playing Dungeons & Dragons. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My area of focus is Consumer Lifecycle Management.</strong> With an interest in understanding consumer behavior, my academic studies revolved around Marketing, Cognitive Psychology, and Data Science. Since then, my professional experience has been consumer-focused with acquisition, engagement, and retention emphasized in different roles.

      content: "Jake is everything you look for in an analyst. He is not simply curious about how things work but is always looking for better ways to get the job done. He is hard working and dedicated to doing something right the first time. He is an amazingly fast learner who picks up new skills like a sponge. He is extremely coachable and looks forward to all feedback. But probably my favorite thing about him is he is an absolute pleasure to work with and the kind of person who makes your day brighter from just interacting with him.
